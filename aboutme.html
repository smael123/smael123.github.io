					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>My name is Ismael Almaguer. I live in the United States in the state of Texas. I graduated from the University of Downtown (UHD) in 2017 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science (Much easier to say Computer Science degree).</p>

					<h3>Academic Life</h3>
					<p>At UHD I decided to major in Computer Science after being undeclared for approximately one year. I have always loved computers ever since my parents brought home a Windows ME computer from Circuit City. Ahh Circuit City. I will miss your red flooring that looked like the red brick road from the movie &ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&rdquo;.</p>
					<p>Anyway, I took many Computer Science and Math courses in my academic life. When I took my first CS class at UHD I felt nervous because I thought that I would not understand the material. But as the course continued I was relieved to find that C++ was understandable and easy to implement a program with.</p>
					<p>In school I took CS courses on Data Structures and Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, Software Engineering, Databases, and Computer Graphics. I took Math courses on Calculus, Digital Logic, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability &amp; Statistics.</p>

				<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				<h4>Video Games</h4>
				<p>I love video games. I first started playing Flash and Shockwave games online with my parents' dial-up internet. My first console was a Gameboy Advance. On that console I played Yoshi's Island. That game is great because of the exploration you can do. Each level has 20 red coins and 5 flowers you have to find to fully complete the level. To this day I have not 100 percented the game.</p>
				<h4>Bad movies</h4>
				<p>You read that right, bad movies. There are some movies that are so bad that they are either good, funny, or both. You can often find more enjoyment out of these kinds of movies compared to &ldquo;good ones&rdquo;.</p>
